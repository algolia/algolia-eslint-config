Enable `quotes-props` to `as-needed` to disallow unecessary quotes (consistency).

### 2.1.2 (2015-07-31):

Disable enforcing comma dangle on multiline strings (forced by airbnb)

### 2.1.1 (2015-07-09):

Disable func-names warnings. They are useful is uncaught exceptions.
There's no point in enforcing func-names, since most browsers
will now show the property name in an uncaught exception.

### 2.1.0 (2015-07-08):

Consistency around spacing

### 2.0.4 (2015-07-03):

Semi colons are back

### 2.0.3 (2015-07-02):

"First" working release, 1.0.0 was doomed (cannot npm unpublish)
